	<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello. I’m Parker and this is my website. Previously, I posted links to interesting pages and (very) occasionally wrote articles of my own. One of the things I dislike about the web is how ephemeral it really is over the scale of multiple years. Because of this I’ve archived the old version of this site <a href="http://1gen.prkr.me" title="The first version of this site">here</a>.</p>

<p>For this new edition of prkr.me I hope to post a little more frequently. Moving away from art directed posts should help make this easier to do. Topics will probably include all the stuff I’m interested in: technology, books, science, music, philosophy, etc. I’ve also decided to start posting photos on my site. The concept here is to select just a few pictures that represent some of my best work. If you’re interested in seeing more pictures check out <a href="http://flickr.com/parker_malenke" title="http://flickr.com/parker_malenke">my Flickr page</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, my goals are to get better at writing by doing it more often and to use my posts as an opportunity to think more thoroughly about topics.</p>

I apologize in advance for the captcha but I figure not many people will email me and I’d like to minimize spam for now.</p>

<h2>Colophon</h2>

<p>My old site was on Wordpress with a custom theme, but I decided that good ol’ WP was overkill for my needs. I’ve caught the static website bug and it seems like all the cool kids are using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" title="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for that these days. I’m using a few plugins to bend wild type Jekyll to my will, mainly for paginating categories (thanks to <a href="http://www.realjenius.com/2012/12/01/jekyll-category-tag-paging-feeds/" title="http://www.realjenius.com/2012/12/01/jekyll-category-tag-paging-feeds/">R.J. Lorimer</a>) and for slurping in Flickr photos (thanks to <a href="http://www.marran.com/tech/integrating-flickr-and-jekyll/" title="http://www.marran.com/tech/integrating-flickr-and-jekyll/">Keith Marran</a>). You can <a href="" title="">view the source</a> on Github if you’re so inclined.</p>

<p>Most of the code typing happened in Sublime Text, powered by my trusty old MacBook Pro of Mid/Late 2007 vintage. In case you were wondering, an SSD makes a big difference even on an old SATA1 machine. I’m looking forward to a Haswell MacBook Pro though.</p>
