	<h2>Metrics Collection &amp; Datastore</h2>

	<p>A large software company recently approached <a href="http://measuringusability.com">Measuring Usability</a> for assistance with designing an internal web application for collecting, analyzing, and reporting usability metrics. The client has an extensive product line encompassing both native desktop and web applications and now wants to unify their usability metrics process, enhancing stakeholder access and lending impact to issues and opportunities discovered across all products. I have acted as the primary contact on the project, engaging in activities such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Participating in discovery meetings, gathering expectations and refining product requirements</li>
		<li>Communicating design concepts with wireframes</li>
		<li>Designing and developing forms for capturing usability data</li>
		<li>Working collaboratively and iterating based on feedback</li>
		<li>Documenting and explaining details of statistical analysis methods for incorporation in the product</li>
		<li>Writing contextual help content that will assist users who are new to user experience research techniques</li>
		<li>And eventually producing webinar based training content</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Following are some example wireframes used to design concepts and user flows:</p>

	<h3>Product Page</h3>
	<p>Each product gets a summary dashboard that surfaces major items such as Customer Satisfaction, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Usability_Scale">System Usability Scale</a>, Community Engagement, and more. Drilling into each section reveals additional details, such as performance over time, performance at key subphases of the customer journey, and comparisons with a consumer software benchmark provided by Measuring Usability.</p>

	</div>

	<h3>Project Page</h3>
	<p>A variety of individual usability projects will contribute data to the top-level product page. Opening a project detail view displays additional information about the project, such as task specifics, participant demographics for a usability study, or supplementary metrics.</p>

	<p>Besides presenting further details on past projects, the project page can also guide users through the process of planning and executing new studies. This series of wireframes walks through the user flow of starting with a blank usability study through planning the details and collecting data to sharing the results at the end.</p>

	<p>Upon starting a new usability study the user is presented with a checklist of tasks that will help them plan, conduct, and share a project. Tools for completing each item appear as they are needed and check off tasks automatically as they are accomplished. For example, the page below is a blank usability study where the first task is to describe the study objectives. The system presents an input box to record this and then checks the item off when the user clicks &lsquo;Save&rsquo;.</p>

			<span class="title">Initial Usability Study Page</span>
		</div>

		</div>
	</div>

	<p>As tasks are completed new tools appear that guide users through each successive step. For example, saving the study objectives marked that item off the list and brought up instructions and an input for uploading a test plan along with a table for entering the study&rsquo;s tasks. Uploading the plan then completes the associated item and removes the tool.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Part of the project involved both designing and developing the forms for collecting usability data either during or after a moderated session. I built and delivered the HTML/CSS forms below for integration into the final product.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Once data has been collected and input into the system tools appear prompting the user to summarize the findings of the study and upload any supporting documents such as video highlight reels, more detailed analysis, or any reports discussing the findings. Actionable discoveries can be recorded as &lsquo;Opportunities&rsquo; which makes them more visible and likely to be addressed. By using this application to plan studies and collect findings that information is now available to many other stakeholders in the organization, and data from many different studies can be pooled to provide an informative look at each product and product line.</p>

	<p>Below is an alternative Project Page concept that integrated the checklist items into the main body of the page.</p>
