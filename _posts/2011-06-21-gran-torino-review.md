I nearly always have certain expectations when I go to see a movie. Rarely does the movie fit those preconceptions. Sometimes it falls short, sometimes it surpasses. Only once in a great while does a film deliver so far beyond my hopes as Gran Torino did.

A very complex, but never confusing tale, Clint Eastwood’s performance contains meaningful conversation on manhood, family, race, neighbors, courage, conviction, life, and death. With excellent acting and a beautiful production quality, this film should be on everyone’s list.
