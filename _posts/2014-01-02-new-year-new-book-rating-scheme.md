A few days ago I completed my goal of reading 35 books in 2013. I've logged all the books I've read for the past three years now (on [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/parkermalenke)), and it's kind of nice to look back at my recent literary history with ease. When I started rating books I didn't really have much of a plan for which books got which ratings. And I felt bad about giving books negative ratings, meaning I rarely gave out one or two stars. This paradigm doesn't have much expressive power, so starting with books I read in 2014 I'm going to use a new rating scheme, specified here:

&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  
I absolutely loved the book---wouldn't change anything about it. There's a good chance I'll recommend these books to most people.

&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  
A very good book. Stood out as an above average read that I enjoyed a lot. Still, some aspects of the book could use improving before reaching five star status.

&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  
Solidly average. No real negatives, but nothing truly outstanding either. Worth spending the time to read, but not necessarily worth re-reading.

&#9733;&#9733;  
Below average. Some redeeming qualities, but my time would probably have been better spent elsewhere. Might still recommend to others if I felt they could enjoy it more.

&#9733;  
A bad book. Didn't enjoy it, and didn't really find anything beneficial in it. Wouldn't recommend to others.

My new rubric doesn't necessarily depend on the re-readability of a book. There are some fantastic books that I would never really plan on re-reading, either because the style of the book doesn't lend itself to that or just because of logistics. (How many times can one read *Infinite Jest*?)
