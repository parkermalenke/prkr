	<h1><a href="/words/2014/new-year-new-book-rating-scheme/">A New Year and a New Book Rating Scheme</a></h1>
	

	<p>A few days ago I completed my goal of reading 35 books in 2013. I&rsquo;ve logged all the books I&rsquo;ve read for the past three years now (on <a href="http://goodreads.com/parkermalenke">Goodreads</a>), and it&rsquo;s kind of nice to look back at my recent literary history with ease. When I started rating books I didn&rsquo;t really have much of a plan for which books got which ratings. And I felt bad about giving books negative ratings, meaning I rarely gave out one or two stars. This paradigm doesn&rsquo;t have much expressive power, so starting with books I read in 2014 I&rsquo;m going to use a new rating scheme, specified here:</p>

<p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br/>
I absolutely loved the book&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t change anything about it. There&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;ll recommend these books to most people.</p>

<p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br/>
A very good book. Stood out as an above average read that I enjoyed a lot. Still, some aspects of the book could use improving before reaching five star status.</p>

<p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br/>
Solidly average. No real negatives, but nothing truly outstanding either. Worth spending the time to read, but not necessarily worth re-reading.</p>

<p>&#9733;&#9733;<br/>
Below average. Some redeeming qualities, but my time would probably have been better spent elsewhere. Might still recommend to others if I felt they could enjoy it more.</p>

<p>&#9733;<br/>
A bad book. Didn&rsquo;t enjoy it, and didn&rsquo;t really find anything beneficial in it. Wouldn&rsquo;t recommend to others.</p>

<p>My new rubric doesn&rsquo;t necessarily depend on the re-readability of a book. There are some fantastic books that I would never really plan on re-reading, either because the style of the book doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to that or just because of logistics. (How many times can one read <em>Infinite Jest</em>?)</p>
