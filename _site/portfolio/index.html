	<h1>Portfolio</h1>

	<h2>Financial Web Application</h2>
	<p>One of our recent projects at <a href="http://measuringusability.com">Measuring Usability</a> involved working with a Fortune 500 company on a financial services product marketed to small businesses across the country. It allows users to offer financing to their customers, process transactions, track customer activity, and more.</p>

	<p>I managed and worked on most aspects of this project, including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Developing, documenting, and communicating a test plan of 8&ndash;9 tasks for moderated user testing</li>
		<li>Facilitating 10 in-person and 10 remote user test sessions, introducing participants to the various tasks, recording errors and UI issues, and prompting users to recount their expectations and experiences with the software</li>
		<li>Collating and analyzing the testing data, prioritizing and reporting areas for improvement</li>
		<li>Redesigning key features of the product based on user feedback with Photoshop mockups</li>
		<li>Documenting recommended design components and patterns in a 4,500+ word report</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Recommendations</h3>
	<p>After observing users and discussing their opinions and experiences I organized the findings and recommendations into three main categories for improvement.</p>

	<h4>Clear Communication</h4>
	<p>Many users of the product are either small business owners/managers or part of a sales staff and aren&rsquo;t extremely knowledgeable about the various terms, techniques, and processes involved with offering financing to customers. In order to make users feel more confident and comfortable the redesign incorporates several opportunities for contextual help and instruction, with the option to access further information if necessary.</p>

	<h4>Obvious Progression</h4>
	<p>One of the problems observed during user testing was a confusion about what the next step in a given process was. For example, users had a hard time following the correct sequence when filling out forms.</p>
	<p>To fix this, my improvements follow a left-aligned, vertical progression for each step in a form or task. Button groups present a single primary action on the left and use active wording to clarify what clicking them will do.</p>

	<h4>Intuitive Organization</h4>
	<p>Findability was another problem that affected many users. In the old design, users must click on each top level navigation heading to reveal subcategories. My proposed redesign moves to a horizontal navigation bar to free up space and follows the standard pattern of revealing subcategories on hover. This makes it easier for users to quickly scan for a feature.</p>
	<p>Beyond the mechanics of the navigation interaction, many users also found the navigation labels to be confusing or nonintuitive. Ideally, a series of tree testing and card sorting studies would be used to develop and validate a new navigation structure. Unfortunately that wasn&rsquo;t a component of this project. Instead, I used comments from user testing to inform the creation of a best-guess alternative.</p>

	<h3>Homepage</h3>
	<p>Many users commented that they wanted fast access to common features (such as transaction processing and new application submission), without exposing basic users (such as sales staff) to more complicated, less relevant advanced tools. My redesign eliminates visual clutter and brings an instructive list of features to the foreground.</p>

	</div>

	<h3>Credit Application Form</h3>
	<p>Submitting a new application for a credit line was one of the hardest tasks for users to perform. In the old design fields were arranged in a grid, with little regard for the logical relationship of the inputs. Nearly half of all users wanted a more intuitive sequence to the entry of information.</p>
	<p>My redesign took that feedback into account and arranges all fields in a left-aligned, vertical manner. Only fields that have a strong logical relationship (such as first name/last name) or which traditionally appear on the same line (such as city and state) exist on the same line. This makes it clear which piece of information the user is currently working on and where to go when moving to the next bit of data.</p>

	</div>

	<h3>Transaction Form</h3>
	<p>Transaction processing is one of the most commonly performed tasks with this product. My recommendations help streamline the process by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Moving all data entry to a single page</li>
		<li>Introducing a more prominent account number lookup button</li>
		<li>Including more detailed instructions on formatting data for forms</li>
		<li>Creating a dropdown that remembers promo codes for users</li>
		<li>Clearer communication on successful task completion</li>
		<li>More readable information about the transaction</li>
	</ul>

	</div>

	<h3>Funding Report</h3>
	<p>This feature currently presents a substantial amount of information in a series of different tables stacked atop each other in the same page. Users found it difficult to parse the information and hard to find a particular piece of information on the page. I recommended several changes to improve the usability of this screen:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Move some of the reporting functionality to a dedicated feature</li>
		<li>Introduce filtering options for quickly finding information of interest</li>
		<li>Increase the contrast between rows with a highlight on hover</li>
		<li>Move additional information about each entry into a separate details view</li>
	</ul>
